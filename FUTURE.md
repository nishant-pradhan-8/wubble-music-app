# 🚀 FUTURE.md — Improvements & Scaling Plans

This document outlines potential future enhancements, scaling strategies, and technical improvements for the **Wubble QuickTune Mini** project.

## 📦 1. Backend & API Improvements

- **Add Database Support:**  
  Use MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store tracks, favorites, and user data dynamically.

- **Admin Upload Interface:**  
  Build a dashboard to allow upload of new music files with tags, titles, and metadata.

- **Stream Audio Securely:**  
  Serve music files via signed URLs or stream endpoints (e.g., AWS S3 + CloudFront) for better control.

## 🎧 2. Audio & Media Enhancements

- **Waveform Visualizer:**  
  Add a real-time waveform or visual spectrum using `wavesurfer.js` or Web Audio API.

- **Playlists / Queues:**  
  Let users create playlists from their liked tracks or generate a random mix.

---

## 🧑‍💻 3. UI/UX & Accessibility

- **Improved Responsive Layout:**  
  Enhance layout for tablets, ultra-wide screens, and small phones.

- **Transitions Between Tracks:**  
  Add fade-out/fade-in when switching tracks for smoother experience.

- **Accessibility Labels:**  
  Add `aria` attributes to improve screen reader support.

## 🔐 4. Auth & User Features

- **User Accounts & Login:**  
  Allow users to log in and save favorites and history to the cloud.

- **OAuth Support:**  
  Enable login via Google or GitHub.

- **Personalized Recommendations:**  
  Use mood + genre history to suggest new tracks.

## 🧪 5. Testing & DevOps

- **Unit & Component Tests:**  
  Use Jest and React Testing Library to cover core UI logic and actions.

- **Backend Tests:**  
  Write tests for route behavior and error handling using Supertest.

---

## 📈 6. Scaling Considerations

- **Cloud Storage for Audio:**  
  Move all music to cloud storage (AWS S3, Firebase, or similar) for better delivery speed and scalability.

- **Rate Limiting:**  
  Add basic rate-limiting middleware to avoid abuse of the `/api/tracks` endpoint.

This project is built as a demo prototype for assessment, but these improvements can make it production-ready with real-time media experiences.
